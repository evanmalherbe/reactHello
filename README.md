# HyperionDev Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp - Level 2 Task 8 - React - First React website

## Description
This is my first little website created using the Create React App Starter Kit. It pulls data from a Javascript object and then displays it on screen in a neat way.

## Instructions
These were the instructions I was given to guide me in creating this website. 

**Follow these steps:**
* Create a folder called ‘L2Task2’ on your local machine.
* Open the command line interface and cd to the folder you have created above.
* Follow the instructions found here to install React using the Create React App Starter Kit. Call your app “react-hello.”
* Once you have started your front-end server (npm start), test the default React app you have just created by navigating to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.
* Modify src/index.js to:
    * Create a JavaScript object called ‘user’ that stores all the details for a particular user of your app. This object should have at least the following properties: name, surname, date_of_birth, country, email, telephone, company, profile_picture, interests. The interests property should be used to store an array of the user’s interests.
    * Create and render an element that displays all the information about the user in an attractive way. This element should:
        * Include at least 1 React-Bootstrap component.

### Technologies
This project uses:
* HTML 5 
* CSS 3
* Javascript ECMAScript 2021
* React.js 17.0.2

## Installation
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run this project, do the following:
1. Copy the directory called 'reactHello' to your local machine.
2. Navigate to this directory from the command line interface. E.g. cd c:/reactHello.
3. In the command line interface type 'npm install'
4. Once it has finished installing, type 'npm start'. This runs the app in the development mode.
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Usage
To use this website, view [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. It's a single page website and there is nothing to do except view the information. See figure 1 below.
